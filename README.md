ONScripter-RU
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/umineko-project/onscripter-ru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/umineko-project/onscripter-ru)

# Android users with offset problem, use the latest version at https://github.com/umineko-project/onscripter-ru

Put `system-offset-x=180` in your `ons.cfg` if you have offset problem. Change 180 to something else if you didn't got the right padding.

#### Different from the main repo

I did some blind patch because of the weird offset in the game and it works for my phone. If you find tapping your phone have no effect on the buttons, it is because the button is somehow miss-placed. In that case, pull down the statusbar real hard so that the navigation bar popup, after that everything should be normal again (maybe?).

This is the visual novel engine empowering [Umineko Project port](https://umineko-project.org) of Umineko no Naku Koro ni from PlayStation 3. Albeit the engine being one of the most powerful publicly available engines for creating visual novels, it contains numerous hacks specific to our needs, lacks API documentation, and may not be suitable for your needs.
